A basic die-rolling based fighting game between a single survivor and a growing number of zombies.

Added a custom print function that will print to the console and also save the output in a text file. Currently overwrites the last textlog when a new game is started.

UPDATE: 14/09/20
Most of the basics are working. Player fights zombies with random levels of sucess. Starts with one zombie, increasing by one each round. If the player kills a zombie, they earn a point. 

At the end of each round, player can choose to upgrade their stats by spending the points they've earned.
